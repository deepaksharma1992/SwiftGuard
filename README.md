# \# 🏦 SwiftGuard: Multi-Agent SWIFT Transaction Processing System

# 

# SwiftGuard is a multi-agent AI system designed to automate validation, fraud detection, analysis, and reporting of SWIFT financial transactions using structured agentic workflows.

# 

# This project demonstrates practical implementation of advanced agent design patterns applied to real-world financial message processing.

# 

# \## 🚀 Project Overview

# 

# International banks process thousands of SWIFT messages daily. These messages must be:

# 

# \- ✅ Validated for format correctness  

# \- 🔍 Screened for fraud  

# \- 🧠 Analyzed through multi-step reasoning  

# \- 📊 Structured into actionable reports  

# 

# SwiftGuard implements this workflow using four distinct agentic design patterns:

# 

# 1\. \*\*Evaluator–Optimizer Pattern\*\*

# 2\. \*\*Parallelization Pattern\*\*

# 3\. \*\*Prompt Chaining Pattern\*\*

# 4\. \*\*Orchestrator–Worker Pattern\*\*

# 

# The system runs end-to-end and generates persistent report files.
